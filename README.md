# Developer Coding Challenge

## Requirements:
1. Build a persistent **file-based** caching mechanism which implements the interface CacheInterface from this repository
    1. The data's types should be preserved when storing and retrieving from the cache.
2. Write a service that connects to a fictional weather applicationâ€™s api. The service
should retrieve the data from the fictional weather api using the three following
criteria:
    1. The url: `www.fakeweather.com/api/v1/?postal_code={zip}`
    2. The API key : `ba8e0c9c-20e8-4b54:c06fc8f9-fbba-4e9c-807cc8bdd0c54687`
    3. The API key must be base64 encoded and added to the `Authorization`
header as a bearer token.
3. The response body for the fictional weather api will have the following structure:

| Field          | Type        | Description |
| -------------  | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------| 
| last_updated   | string	     | Local time when the real time data was updated.  |
| temperature  	 | decimal	   | Temperature in fahrenheit.                       |
| feels_like 	   | decimal	   | Feels like temperature in fahrenheit.            |
| wind_mph	     | decimal	   | Wind speed in miles per hour.                    |
| wind_degree	   | int	       | Wind direction in degrees.|
| wind_direction | string	     | Wind direction as 16 point compass. e.g.: NSW. |
| pressure  	   | decimal	   | Pressure in inches. |
| precipitation	 | decimal	   | Precipitation amount in inches. |
| humidity	     | int	       | Humidity as percentage. |
| cloud 	       | int	       | Cloud cover as percentage.|
| is_day	       | boolean     | Whether or not it is currently daytime.|
| uv	           | decimal	   | UV Index.|
| gust_mph	     | decimal	   | Wind gust in miles per hour.|
| visibility     | decimal     | Visibility in miles. |

Here is an example payload:
```
 "data": {
        "last_updated": "2022-04-04 16:30",
        "temperature": 70.0,
        "is_day": true,
        "wind_mph": 13.6,
        "wind_degree": 210,
        "wind_direction": "SSW",
        "pressure": 30.0,
        "precipitation": 0.0,
        "humidity": 30,
        "cloud": 0,
        "feels_like": 70.0,
        "visibility": 9.0,
        "uv": 6.0,
        "gust_mph": 7.2
    }
```

4. The service should cache the api results for 5 minutes.
5. Write another class that is capable of returning the cached result or results from
the service if the cache is expired.
6. You may not use **any** packages or frameworks expect for PHPUnit.
